# Lady Assets

## Game Design

Large uneven terrain, like a yard/garden. You are a small ladybug in this big garden, who is trying to find all the stars in the/each world, which is surrounded by a white picket fence and has no night cycle.

There are ants that if they see you in their patrol, you "die" and return to the start (a mound of dirt)

You must traverse water and climb the plants themselves to get to all the stars, sometimes leaping off the edge of one to fall down. No jumping, only walking.

## Overall goals

1. Multiple levels
2. Tutorial levels 1-3 or something
3. Level selector main menu
4. Main menu has a screen to go to the help section (using game_doc)
5. If they get stuck, use the i key to bring up the in-game menu (respawn possible)

## Menu design

```
Main menu
    - button - Help Menu using markdown2formspec
    - button - Attribution page using markdown2formspec
    - button -Levels selection, just an array of buttons decending down (8 levels maybe?)
```

## Music Design

Just use Recorded Piano that I play, looped. Possibly one for each level

## In order of todo

1. level loading method (maybe use world edit)
2. Blender workflow
3. Gameplay programming
4.
